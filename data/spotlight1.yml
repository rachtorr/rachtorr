   I am motivated to improve how we can efficiently use water resources and vegetation as green infrastructure to make cities more equitable and sustainable. At UCSB, I worked in the 
   <a target="_blank" href="https://tagueteamlab.org/">Tague Lab</a>
    and used the eco-hydrologic model <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RHESSys/RHESSys">RHESSys</a>. 
    My <a target="_blank" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/climate/articles/10.3389/fclim.2024.1280615/full">dissertation research</a> explored how urban tree ecosystem services are affected by climate-driven heatwaves and drought, shifting irrigation regimes, and variation in neighboring land surfaces. I used high-resolution remote sensing data and sensitivity analysis to improve representation of tree species in the model, and developed a module for simulating sub-grid surface water routing.
